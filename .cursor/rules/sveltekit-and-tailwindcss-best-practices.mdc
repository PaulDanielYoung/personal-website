- Organize the project directory logically, grouping related files and functionality.
- Use clear and descriptive folder and file names that reflect their purpose and content.
- Include a brief `README.md` in major directories to explain their purpose and contents.
- Components must follow explicit naming conventions:
  - Use PascalCase for Svelte components (e.g., `Component.svelte`).
  - Components should clearly indicate their role or context within the application.
- Avoid special characters, spaces, or ambiguous naming in file names.
- Regularly review and clean up unused or obsolete files.
