- Strictly use explicit types; avoid using implicit `any`.
- Interfaces and type definitions related to auditing must clearly describe their purpose.
- Type naming should use PascalCase, such as `AuditPlan`, `RiskAssessment`, and `Finding`.
- Provide JSDoc-style comments for all exported types and interfaces.
