- Follow a consistent structure for audit projects:
  - `/audit-planning/` – All planning phase-related files.
  - `/risk-assessment/` – Risk assessment documents and scripts.
  - `/fieldwork/` – Fieldwork-related data collection, tests, and documentation.
  - `/reporting/` – Audit reports and executive summaries.
- Ensure new modules and components clearly map to audit lifecycle phases.
- Always document new folders with a brief README describing purpose and contents.
